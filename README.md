# 26 Directory File Naming Conventions

## not-found.js
- The not-found file is used to render UI when the **notFound function** is thrown within a route segment.
- Along with serving a custom UI, Next.js will also return a 404 HTTP status code.
- The root app/not-found.js file handles any unmatched URLs for your whole application.
- not-found.js components **do not accept any props**.
